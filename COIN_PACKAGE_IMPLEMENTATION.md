# Coin Package API Integration - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The coin package purchasing feature has been fully integrated with your backend APIs. The implementation follows the use case scenario you provided.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Service Layer (`src/services/api.js`)
Created a centralized API service with two endpoints:
- **Get All Packages**: `GET /coinpackage/getall`
- **Buy Package**: `POST /coinpackage/buy-package`

### 2. Enhanced Packages Component (`src/pages/Packages.jsx`)

#### Features Implemented:
‚úÖ **Automatic Package Loading**
- Fetches packages from API on component mount
- Maps API response (name, price, coins, id) to UI format
- Adds color schemes and features based on package tier

‚úÖ **Loading State**
- Shows spinner while fetching packages
- User-friendly loading message

‚úÖ **Error Handling**
- Network error detection
- Retry functionality
- Clear error messages

‚úÖ **Purchase Flow** (Following Use Case Scenario)
1. User views available packages (Silver/Gold/Diamond)
2. Selects a package
3. Reviews order summary
4. Confirms payment method
5. Processes payment via API
6. Receives success confirmation
7. Views receipt with transaction details
8. Can purchase multiple packages

‚úÖ **API Response Handling**
- Success (statusCode: "02"): Credits coins and shows receipt
- Failure: Shows error with retry option
- Network errors: Shows timeout message

‚úÖ **Receipt Display**
- Transaction ID (from API)
- Payment date (from API)
- Package details
- Amount paid
- Payment method
- New coin balance

## API Response Mapping

### Get Packages Response
```json
{
  "statusCode": "02",
  "message": "Available packages",
  "content": [
    {
      "name": "Silver",
      "price": 2000.0,
      "coins": 1000,
      "id": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Buy Package Response
```json
{
  "statusCode": "02",
  "message": "Package bought successfully",
  "content": {
    "paymentId": 9,
    "userId": 1,
    "amount": 2000.0,
    "paymentDate": "2025-10-16T19:17:59.7636191",
    "paymentMethod": "CARD"
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Backend URL
Currently set to: `http://localhost:8080`

To change this, edit `src/services/api.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080';
```

### User ID
Currently hardcoded as `userId: 1` in the component.
In production, this should come from your authentication context.

Location: `src/pages/Packages.jsx`, line 21-25

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Your Backend Server
Ensure your backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### ‚úÖ Happy Path (Success)
1. Navigate to the Packages page
2. Verify packages load from API
3. Select a package (e.g., Silver)
4. Review order summary
5. Select payment method (default: CARD)
6. Click "Pay Now"
7. Verify success message appears
8. Click "View Receipt"
9. Verify receipt shows correct details from API
10. Click "Buy Another" to test multiple purchases

#### ‚ùå Error Scenarios
1. **Network Error**: Stop backend ‚Üí Page will show error with retry button
2. **API Failure**: If backend returns non-02 statusCode ‚Üí Shows error message
3. **Payment Declined**: Shows retry option with error message

## Payment Methods Supported
- CARD (Credit/Debit Card)
- PAYPAL
- BANK_TRANSFER
- MOBILE_PAYMENT

These match the backend's expected payment method values.

## CORS Configuration

If you encounter CORS errors, configure your backend to allow:
- Origin: `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite dev server port)
- Methods: `GET, POST, OPTIONS`
- Headers: `Content-Type`

Example Spring Boot CORS configuration:
```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:5173")
```

## Key Files Modified/Created

1. ‚ú® **NEW**: `src/services/api.js` - API service layer
2. üîÑ **UPDATED**: `src/pages/Packages.jsx` - Full API integration
3. üìù **NEW**: `COIN_PACKAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This guide

## Features Aligned with Use Case

‚úÖ User opens Coin Packages  
‚úÖ System shows Silver/Gold/Diamond with prices (from API)  
‚úÖ User selects a package and reviews order summary  
‚úÖ User confirms payment method and taps Pay  
‚úÖ System requests authorization from payment (API call)

‚úÖ Declined: Show reason and allow retry/change method  
‚úÖ Multiple purchases: User can buy another package after success  
‚úÖ Timeout/Error: No credit; show error and safe retry  

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication**: Integrate with your auth system to get real user ID
2. **Coin Balance**: Fetch initial coin balance from backend
3. **Transaction History**: Add a page to view past purchases
4. **Payment Gateway**: Integrate real payment processing if needed
5. **Notifications**: Add toast notifications for better UX

## Troubleshooting

### Packages Not Loading
- Check backend is running on port 8080
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoint `/coinpackage/getall` is accessible
- Check for CORS issues

### Purchase Fails
- Verify userId is valid in your backend
- Check packageId exists in database
- Review backend logs for errors
- Ensure request body format matches API expectations

### Display Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Check that package names match exactly (Silver, Gold, Diamond)
- Verify API returns statusCode: "02" for success

## Support
For issues or questions, check:
1. Browser console for error messages
2. Backend logs for API errors
3. Network tab to inspect API calls and responses
